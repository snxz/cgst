Schedule theming extension. WIP

## Adding themes
To create a new theme, you can add a new row in the [themes spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RbNrBAiWmcq_gNjFFevXHAbtie4qDT6cSMPgA6-ZBvc). You must be signed in with your Catlin Google account to make edits. Changes are synchronized from the sheet to the extension every 12 hours.
